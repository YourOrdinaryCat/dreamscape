A tiny little blog, about as irrelevant as I am. I've always struggled to keep up with this kind of thing after a while, so I thank Jekyll & GitHub for making it so easy to create and add content to this blog. Some fun facts:

- This blog works on IE11! Having a bunch of fallbacks for CSS variables is annoying, but I don't plan on updating the styling for now, so that shouldn't be a problem. You shouldn't be using IE11 these days, but seeing my website work on Windows Phone 8.1 is just so cool, I have to keep supporting it!

- The bottom padding isn't a mistake. [Putting the "You" in CPU](https://cpu.land) explains the why perfectly:

> The bottom of every page is padded so readers can maintain a consistent eyeline.

- The original name was ☆ dreamspace ☆, but that happens to be the name of a song with less than appropriate lyrics. I am very salty about this because the original name sounds cooler to me, but it is what it is. Wouldn't want that to show up if someone looks up this blog by its name.
